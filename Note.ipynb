    "In cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with elliptic-curve cryptography in general, the bit size of the public key believed to be needed for ECDSA is about twice the size of the security level, in bits. For example, at a security level of 80 bits (meaning an attacker requires a maximum of about 2^80 operations to find the private key) the size of an ECDSA public key would be 160 bits, whereas the size of a DSA public key is at least 1024 bits. On the other hand, the signature size is the same for both DSA and ECDSA: approximately 4t bits, where t is the security level measured in bits, that is, about 320 bits for a security level of 80 bits.\n",

    "Bitcoin uses the secp256k1 elliptic curve for public key and signature genereration. \n",
    "ECDSA can be thought of as a special form of mathematics where division is, for all practical purposes, impossible. Public keys are formed from private keys by multiplication -- the public key is multiplied by the generator G. Because of the properties of multiplication, new public keys can be generated by an entity that doesn't know the corresponding private key.\n",
